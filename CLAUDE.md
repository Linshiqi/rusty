# rusty — embedded Rust workbench

A desktop workbench for embedded Rust, ESP32 first, STM32 next. Not an editor:
it owns the half of the job rust-analyzer does not — which chip, which
toolchain, what fits in flash, what is on the serial port, and an assistant that
can call all of it.

## Commands

```bash
# Everything, the way CI runs it
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets

# The frontend links only the model layers, so these must stay green
cargo check -p rusty-core -p rusty-embed -p rusty-ai \
  --no-default-features --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Frontend (Trunk drives the wasm build; there is no Node in this repo)
cd crates/rusty-ui && trunk serve

# The whole app
cd crates/rusty-app && cargo tauri dev

# The workbench without the window
cargo run -p rusty-cli -- check .
cargo run -p rusty-cli -- size target/riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf/release/app
```

## Layout

| Crate | Does |
|---|---|
| `rusty-core` | Cargo workspace analysis: dependency graph, duplicates, feature unification |
| `rusty-embed` | Chips, boards, project detection, toolchain, memory, flashing, wizard |
| `rusty-ai` | Bring-your-own-LLM providers, the tool registry, the agent loop |
| `rusty-app` | Tauri backend — thin, no analysis lives here |
| `rusty-ui` | Leptos frontend (Trunk + Tailwind, no npm) |
| `rusty-cli` | Headless entry point; the CI and bug-report surface |

## The rules that are load-bearing

### 1. Every crate is split by a `backend` feature

`model` (and `catalog`'s data types) compile to `wasm32` and contain no IO.
Everything that spawns a process, reads a file, or walks a graph sits behind
`backend`. The frontend takes each crate with `default-features = false` and
`use`s the model types **directly** — there is no generated binding layer, so
the wire contract cannot drift.

Adding a field to a model type is free. Adding an `std::process` call to one is
a build break on wasm, which is the point.

### 2. File formats and wire formats are different types

`catalog.rs` parses TOML into its own structs and converts to `model`. The file
format is a public contract with users who write board definitions; `model` is
an internal contract with the frontend. Tying them together means a UI refactor
silently breaking everybody's board files.

### 3. Refuse rather than guess

The recurring failure mode in this domain is a plausible answer that sends
someone down a wrong path for an hour. So:

- No probe-rs target for an STM32 → error telling them to run `probe-rs chip list`,
  not a guessed name with the wrong memory map.
- A chip not in the catalogue → `known: false` **and** a note telling the model
  not to describe it from memory.
- A serial flash for a part with no serial bootloader → refuse and say why.

When a tool cannot answer, it says what is missing in terms the caller can act
on. Silence makes a model invent something.

### 4. The analyses are the assistant's tools

`rusty-ai`'s registry wraps `rusty-core` and `rusty-embed`. The assistant does
not read `.cargo/config.toml` and theorise; it calls `project_status` and gets
the actual mismatch. Tool descriptions are written against the specific failure
they exist to prevent, not as feature summaries — see `tools/embedded.rs`.

Adding an analysis means adding a tool. The same definitions are intended to
back an MCP server later, so third parties get them too.

### 5. Extensibility is data first

See `docs/extensibility.md`. Chips and boards are TOML in three layers
(built-in < user config < `<project>/.rusty/`). Code extensions go through MCP.
UI contributions are declarative — extensions never ship markup or styles.

## Testing conventions

- **Assert on *which* problem, not that something failed.** These panels exist
  to name a specific mistake; a test that only checks `problems.len() > 0`
  passes while reporting the wrong thing.
- **Test the property, not the number.** `disabling_defaults_removes_serde`
  survives an upstream crate splitting a dependency out; `assert_eq!(crates, 8)`
  does not.
- **Fixtures are real.** `rusty-core/tests/fixtures/feature-lab` is a genuine
  workspace; `tests/memory.rs` writes a real ELF with `object`'s writer. Mocks
  would not have caught the section-flag classification bugs.
- The built-in catalogue is checked by a `debug_assert!` at load — a typo in
  `data/*.toml` would otherwise surface only as a part mysteriously missing.

## Hard-won specifics

- **Never use PowerShell to transform source files.** It corrupted this repo
  twice: once mangling UTF-8 comments read as ANSI, once flattening a nested
  array so `$pair[0]` indexed a *character* and replaced every `u` with `s`
  across four files. Use the editing tools. If a bulk change is needed, do it
  file by file.
- **TOML scoping**: in `data/boards.toml`, every scalar key must precede the
  first `[[board.usb]]` or `[board.pins]` header. A `flash_baud` after the usb
  block is parsed as a usb field. `deny_unknown_fields` catches it.
- `object` 0.40 wraps ELF section flags in newtypes; read `sh_flags`/`sh_type`
  off `SectionFlags::Elf` rather than trusting `SectionKind`, because these
  linker scripts invent section names (`.rwtext`, `.rodata_wifi`) that no
  heuristic classifies correctly.
- `serde_json` sends `i64` as a plain JSON number, so model deltas are `i32` —
  a 64-bit integer would have generated a TypeScript `bigint` that never matched
  the wire.
- Child processes get `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows; the toolchain panel probes
  six tools on open and would otherwise flash six console windows.

## After every feature: review before moving on

Not a release ritual — a step in finishing the feature.

1. **Dead code.** Did this leave an unused `pub fn`, a struct field nothing
   reads, a helper duplicated in two modules? `cargo clippy --all-targets`
   catches private ones; public API needs a grep for call sites.
2. **Did the seams hold?** Does the new code respect the `backend` split, the
   file/wire separation, and refuse-rather-than-guess? If it needed an
   exception, that is a design signal, not a licence.
3. **Is anything now stale?** A pivot leaves debris: config pointing at deleted
   directories, a CLI that predates the domain, docs describing the old
   positioning.
4. **Should the architecture change?** Cheap now, expensive later — the chip
   catalogue became data before boards were referenced everywhere; the AI tool
   context was generalised before a second consumer existed.
5. **Update this file** if a convention was established or a trap was found.
